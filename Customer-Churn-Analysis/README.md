# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis (Python + Excel)

This project analyzes customer churn behavior using the **Telco Customer Churn dataset**. It includes both **machine learning in Python** and **visual dashboards in Excel**, providing a comprehensive view of churn factors and predictions.

## 📁 Dataset Used

**Source:** [Telco Customer Churn - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)  
**File:** `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`

The dataset contains telecom customer data including demographics, services used, account info, and churn status.

## 🧠 Python Analysis (Machine Learning)

Implemented using:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

### Key Steps:
1. Load and clean the dataset
2. Encode categorical variables
3. Split data for training and testing
4. Train models and evaluate accuracy
5. Visualize churn distribution and feature impacts

### Output:
- Accuracy and classification reports
- Charts showing churn by `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`, etc.

## 📈 Excel-Based Visualization

Created charts using Microsoft Excel:
- ✅ Churn Rate (Pie Chart)
- ✅ Churn by Gender (Column Chart)
- ✅ Churn by Contract Type (Bar Chart)
- ✅ Monthly Charges vs Churn (Scatter Plot)
- ✅ Total Charges Distribution (Histogram)
- ✅ Services Used vs Churn (Stacked Bar)

These visuals provide quick insights into who is churning and why.
