# Titanic Data Analysis 🚢

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using Logistic Regression. It includes data cleaning, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## 📁 Dataset
Make sure you have the `train.csv` file in the specified path:
```
/Users/fizasiddiqui/Desktop/titanic/train.csv
```

## 📊 Steps Covered
1. Load and inspect the dataset
2. Clean and preprocess data
3. Visualize survival patterns
4. Train a Logistic Regression model
5. Evaluate the model's performance

## 📌 Features Used
- Passenger Class (`Pclass`)
- Gender (`Sex`)
- Age
- Siblings/Spouse aboard (`SibSp`)
- Parents/Children aboard (`Parch`)
- Fare

## 📈 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 🧠 Model
Logistic Regression model for binary classification (Survived or Not).

## 🎥 Demo

```

## ✅ Output
- Survival count visualization by gender
- Age distribution by passenger class
- Accuracy and classification report of the model
